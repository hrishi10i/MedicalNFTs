    "# MedLink Project Overview\n",
    "## Objective\n",
    "MedLink is a decentralized platform for securely managing, sharing, and commercializing medical documents using NFTs (non-fungible tokens) on blockchain. It empowers patients and doctors with full control, security, and authenticity over health records, as well as enabling ethical sharing/selling of data to researchers and advertisers.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Problem Addressed\n",
    "- **Patient Inconvenience:** Fragmented and hard-to-transfer records.\n",
    "- **Doctor Difficulty:** Accessing distributed or insecure data.\n",
    "- **Loss of Patient Control:** Centralized data stores, privacy risks.\n",
    "- **Data Quality Issues:** Researchers/advertisers often lack access to quality, ethically sourced data.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Solution & Benefits\n",
    "### For Patients\n",
    "- **Data Security:** Records stored immutably on blockchain.\n",
    "- **Authenticity:** NFTs prevent data fraud, allow provenance/tracking.\n",
    "- **Full Control:** Patients decide who accesses or purchases their data.\n",
    "- **Burn Feature:** Option to destroy NFT records if desired.\n",
    "\n",
    "### For Doctors\n",
    "- **Unified System:** All records accessed via NFT dashboard.\n",
    "- **Blockchain Storage:** Secure, cost-effective, transparent.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Technical Architecture\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Smart Contract (Solidity)\n",
    "- Implements ERC721-based NFT logic for medical documents.\n",
    "- Main Features:\n",
    "  - Minting, listing, selling, transferring, burning NFTs\n",
    "  - Seller/buyer controls and record access permissions\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Web Frontend (React)\n",
    "- Main App routing for signup, dashboard, listing, transfer, and marketplace flows\n",
    "- Integrates MetaMask or other wallets for authentication & transaction signing\n",
    "- Components for patients, doctors, and business interaction\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Backend/Deployment\n",
    "- **Hardhat** for Ethereum dev, deployment and tests\n",
    "- Deployment script generates ABI/interface for frontend\n",
    "- (Metadata storage assumed via local/remote storage)\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Libraries & Stack\n",
    "- **Smart contract:** Solidity, OpenZeppelin, Chainlink\n",
    "- **Frontend:** React, MDB React UI, Tailwind, React Router\n",
    "- **Web3/Deployment:** ethers.js, Hardhat\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Core Workflows\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **User Signup/Login**: Users connect a crypto wallet.\n",
    "2. **Medical Record Upload**: Patients upload and mint record NFTs.\n",
    "3. **NFT Marketplace**: Buy, sell, or transfer medical record NFTs.\n",
    "4. **NFT Burn**: Patients may burn (destroy) their data NFT.\n",
    "5. **Doctor Record Access**: Doctors view/update patient NFTs as allowed.\n",
    "6. **Data Sales/Consent**: Patients can monetize their data ethically.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Security & Compliance\n",
    "- Enforced wallet authentication and logging\n",
    "- Stated compliance with HIPAA, GDPR (privacy standards)\n",
    "- Full patient access control, with revocation options\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
